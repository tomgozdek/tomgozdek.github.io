description: The pieces in this record mostly come from the WM2 (Kk.I.2) manuscript in Krakow. The manuscript's history isn't entirely clear. It's binding suggests it may have been produced before the Rorantists' Kapelle, originally beeing a property of an earlier royal ensemble. It became possesion of the Rorantists' Kapelle in early 17th century at the later. The manuscript identifies a copyist, John Mirimicus, who was a Rorantist in 1597-1622 or 1623. The manuscript was being edited and used during performances for at least two hundred years. It's not just the source that connects the pieces used for this record. Most of them are sections of the Proper of the Mass meant to be performed around Christmastime. In addition, the record includes an anoymous mass, two settings of the Magnificat and Marcin Paligon's Rorate Caeli.
