description: The third recording dedicated to the Rorantists's Kapelle is a look at the oldest part of their heritage - all the pieces in this album were probably written in the first half of the 16th century and most of them are devoted to the Mother God. Sebastian of Felsztyn (died after 1543) deserves special attention. He was a music theorist, an author of didcatic treaties describing polyphonic notation and questions of Gregorian chant. He had no links with the Kapelle but besides three of his Marian compositions can be found in ensemble's collection. Those pieces appear in several Kapelle sources from different periods which suggests that the group was keen to perform his works.
