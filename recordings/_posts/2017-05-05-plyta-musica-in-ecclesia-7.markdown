They were composed by Jakub Gołąbek, who was active in the Cracow Cathedral ensemble probably between 1774-1789. Until recently the literature of the subject referred only to four 4-voice Masses a capella by Gołąbek. Since 1980s, another 4-voice Mass cycles, previously unknown, have been discovered. Gołąbek's 4-voice Mass cycles are of the sine Credo type; they include Kyrie, Gloria, Sanctus and Agnus Dei. The tonalities of the cycles employ few chromatic signs C major, F major, G minor.
