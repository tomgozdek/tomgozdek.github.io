description: Men's Vocal Ensemble Gregorianum was founded in 2005 by a group of musicians who had been part of a children's choir known under the same name, with education received in music schools and brass orchestras. All of them share their love of early music. Since the beginning the group has been conducted by Berenika Jozajtis, a graduate of choir conducting at the Frederic Chopin Academy of Music in Warsaw, in the class of Professor Henryk Wojnarowski. Gregorianum specializes in early music, both religious and secular. The group gained recognition during early-music festivals in Gorzow Wielkopolski or Swieradow Zdroj, in Poland. It has been a laureate of the following competitions
