description: Much of the works by Italian composers that are preserved in Rorantist manuscripts are devoted to the martyr saints of the Catholic Church, including the saints who had links with Poland. For this reason, the choice of music for this album was governed by two themes - Italians and saints. A majority of the works in this recording was penned by composers of Italian descent - Franciscus Lilius, Asprilio Pacelli, Annibale Orgas and Bernardino Terzago. The album includes two anonymous pieces also most likely written by Italian composers. Five motets - two Italian, one Polish and two anonymous - are devoted to martyr saints. Two settings of the Magnificat frame this album. It is the second album of Men's Vocal Ensemble Gregorianum devoted in its entirety to the work of the Rorantists' Kapelle from Krakow. The first, under the title Magnificat anima mea Dominum, was released in October 2013.
